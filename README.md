# Software Architecture Books

A comprehensive list of books on Software Architecture.

People in the software industry have long argued about a definition of architecture. Ralph Johnson famously defined
software architecture as "the important stuff (whatever that is)." I, subjectively, followed his definition while
deciding whether or not to include a specific book.

## What is this?

This is NOT a recommendation list. When I made this, I intended for a comprehensive list excluding low-profile books—see
inclusion criteria below. There was a simple reason behind that: I'm not a subject-matter expert on all these topics. In
fact, I not a subject-matter expert on even a single topic of these. More importantly, I don't know your experience
level nor your preferences. Some people prefer theoretical over practical books (I do). Others prefer foundational over
comprehensive books or dry over engaging books or art-based over engineering-based books. Some people even enjoy verbose
over concise books. Or and or and or.

## How did I make this?

I thoroughly reviewed all books
[tagged with software-architecture](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/software-architecture) on Goodreads and applied
a simple algorithmic rules—see the inclusion criteria below. I don't think the list is perfectly comprehensive. Yet, I'm
planning to update it regularly to make it as comprehensive as possible.

## What should I read?

Don't be overwhelmed by the number of books on each subject. Practically speaking, you are supposed to read a few books
on the subjects of your interest. Deciding what to read is your business. Personally, I start by reading a couple of
reviews on Goodreads and examine the book table of content, if available. When in doubt, I read more reviews over the
internet from blogs and the like. Alternatively, you may go with the Goodreads community preferences and start from the
top of each list if you don't have the time to read reviews.

## Inclusion criteria

- The book must be relevant to Software Architecture; and
- The content is not obsolete.
- It must be technology agnostic or applicable to a wide range of technologies; and
- The book profile on Goodreads matches these rules:
    - An average rating of 3.5 or above; and
    - A total number of ratings equals 50 or above.
    - At least 5 written reviews.
    - A minimum length of 50 pages.

## Sorting criteria

The books are sorted solely based on the number of **written** reviews. There are, however, other important factors
worth considering. For example, the average rating, the number of ratings, and the publishing date. Yet, I don't have an
idea to put all these factors in a reasonable mathematical formula. If you have
any, [I'd love to hear](https://github.com/mhadidg/software-architecture-books/issues/new) what you've got in mind.
